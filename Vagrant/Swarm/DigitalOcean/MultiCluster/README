This project is to run a MultiCluster environment.

1. $ vi Swarm/swarm.conf
2. $ cd Swarm
3. $ source swarm.launch

################## old README
Then 
In the "Stack" folder you will find:
- the "stack.yml" file with the stack configuration
- the configuration of the data centers: "dc1.conf" and "dc2.conf"
- the configuration of the swarm: "swarm.conf"

Once configured the swarm then you will go to the "Swarm" folder and run the following command:
$ source swarm.launch

This will create a "Deployment" folder with a subfolder named "dc1" or "dc2" (as desired).

In this last subfolder there will be three more subfolders:
- "m1" with the Vagrantfile of the swarm leader
- "mX" with the Vagrantfile of the rest of the managers
- "wX" with the Vagrantfile of the workers

From any of these subfolders you can access the corresponding nodes with the command (for example to access the 3rd manager from DC1):
$ vagrant status
$ vagrant ssh m3.dc1 -c "docker node ls"

You first need to fix the file token_do.FAKE that is in the parent folder: "../token_do.FAKE"
Please follow the instructions reading the file.
